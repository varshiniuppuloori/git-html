    <p>A cloud kitchen—also referred to as a “ghost kitchen” or “virtual kitchen”—is a commercial kitchen space that
        provides food businesses the facilities and services needed to prepare menu items for delivery and takeout.
        Unlike
        traditional brick-and-mortar locations, cloud kitchens allow food businesses to create and deliver food products
        with minimal overhead.</p>

    <p> <strong> Benefits of cloud kitchen</strong> </p>
    <p> Virtual kitchens (a/k/a cloud kitchens or ghost kitchens) are a great alternative to the traditional
        brick-and-mortar restaurant. Ghost kitchens offer users the freedom to focus on food preparation and product
        marketing and minimize the administrative hassle and logistics that often burden food businesses.</p>

    <p class="style1">Food quality and food safety With a delivery-only brand, your reputation relies on the food
        getting to the
        customer in perfect condition.
        Getting this right is the only way to get repeat orders. There are significant challenges in keeping the product
        at proper temperatures so it arrives as intended to the customer. Not just at the right temperature for them to
        best enjoy it but also to ensure it is safe to eat. </p>
    <p class="style1"> What’s behind the cloud kitchen trend?
        Cloud kitchens started popping up in the early 2010s in response to increased demand for high-quality meal
        delivery and rising rents in city center locations. Green Summit Group opened one of the first cloud kitchens in
        New York City in 2013, and have grown out to four locations across two cities. Many more start-ups have followed
        suit and as we enter a new decade, cloud kitchens are becoming big business, with venture capital pouring into
        start-ups specifically aiming to take advantage of this new market.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: aquamarine;"> 8.Hyperlinks</h1>
    <p>The trend is driven by the coming of age of millennials with disposable income demanding digital, mobile-friendly
        solutions. And this will only get more pronounced as the next generation, who have grown-up with the internet
        and smartphones, enters the marketplace (sorry boomers). Looking further forward, advances in kitchen
        automation, drone delivery, and the continued growth of the gig economy look to give cloud kitchens more of an
        advantage by lowering their costs even further.</p>

    <p id="id1">Kitchen United
        Former executives at Taco Bell and McDonalds have teamed up to create the fast-growing Kitchen United, which
        recently added another $40 million to its initial funding round of $10 million led by GV, the investment fund of
        Google’s parent company, Alphabet. With the might of Google behind it and experienced founders, Kitchen United
        is another big name to watch in the cloud kitchen world.</p>
    <p id="id2">Virtual Kitchen Co
        Virtual Kitchen Co. recently announced its formal launch after securing $15 million of Series A funding from
        ‘super angel’ investors Andreessen Horowitz and automation-focussed investment firm Base10 Partners. Virtual
        Kitchen Co, which already operates several delivery-only kitchens in San Francisco, plans to open a dozen more
        in the Bay Area in the next six months. </p>
    <p id="id3">DoorDash Kitchens
